# Analyzing-the-Impact-of-Car-Features-on-Price-and-Profitability

### Project Description

The automotive industry is witnessing a significant shift towards sustainability and innovation, with electric and hybrid vehicles gaining popularity alongside traditional gasoline-powered cars. Amidst this evolving landscape, understanding the factors influencing consumer demand and optimizing pricing and product development are crucial for car manufacturers aiming to maximize profitability.

#### Objective

This project aims to help a car manufacturer optimize its pricing and product development strategies to enhance profitability while meeting consumer demand. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset, we seek to uncover key insights into the relationships between car features, market categories, and pricing.

#### Approach

To address the objective, we employed the following methodology:

1. **Understanding the Dataset**: The dataset comprised 11,914 rows and 16 columns, including various car features, pricing details, and market categories.
2. **Data Cleaning**: We handled missing values, removed duplicates, and validated outliers, resulting in a cleaned dataset of 11,199 rows.
3. **Data Analysis**: Using regression analysis and market segmentation, we explored the relationships between car features, pricing, and market categories to identify trends and insights.

#### Techniques and Tools

- **Microsoft Excel 2021**: Utilized for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization due to its robust functionalities and user-friendly interface.
- **Analysis ToolPak Add-in**: Employed for performing regression analysis to understand the impact of various features on car pricing.

#### Insights

- **Popularity of Car Models**: Market Category N/A has the highest number of car models, followed by Crossover, Flex Fuel, and Luxury categories. Crossover, Flex Fuel, Performance, Diesel, and Hybrid categories are particularly popular among consumers.
- **Engine Power vs. Price**: A positive relationship exists between a car’s engine power (HP) and its price (MSRP), indicating that cars with higher engine power tend to be priced higher.
- **Key Pricing Features**: Engine Cylinders, city MPG, highway MPG, and Engine HP are the most significant features influencing a car’s price.
- **Manufacturer Pricing**: Bugatti, Maybach, Rolls-Royce, and Lamborghini have the highest average car prices.
- **Fuel Efficiency vs. Cylinders**: There is a negative relationship between fuel efficiency (MPG) and the number of engine cylinders, meaning cars with more cylinders tend to be less fuel-efficient.

#### Dashboard and Key Insights

We created an interactive dashboard to visualize key insights and answer critical business questions such as:

- Distribution of car prices by brand and body style.
- Brands with the highest and lowest average MSRPs.
- Impact of features like transmission type on MSRP.
- Variation in fuel efficiency across different body styles and model years.
- Relationships between horsepower, MPG, and price across different brands.

#### Results and Learnings

This project provided valuable experience in data preprocessing, handling missing values, and performing advanced data analysis using Excel. Key skills acquired include:

- Regression Analysis and Market Segmentation using Excel’s Analysis ToolPak.
- Creation of interactive dashboards with slicers and filters.
- In-depth understanding of the factors influencing car pricing and profitability.

#### Conclusion

By leveraging data analysis, this project offers actionable insights for car manufacturers to optimize their pricing and product development strategies, thereby improving market competitiveness and profitability. The findings can guide manufacturers in focusing on high-demand features and categories, ensuring alignment with consumer preferences and industry trends.
